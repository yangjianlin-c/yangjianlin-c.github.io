# How to build 2R resistor model in Flotherm

In this article, we will build a 2R resistor model in Flotherm.

First, click the **compact component** in the **Prject manager creater panel**. Then edit the component detial as follows:

- Model: 
    - Model type, select **2R resistor model**.
    - Junction power, set the power of this device.
- Network: set the junction to top and junction to bottom thermal resistance values.

!!! note

    The top and bottom side define by the Z axis of this devices. The top side is the high side in Z directoin, while the bottom side is the low side in Z direction. Shows in the figure below.
