## MAX31855

The MAX31855 is a sophisticated thermocouple-to-digital converter with a built-in 14-bit analog-to-digital converter \(ADC\). The device also contains cold-junction compensation sensing and correction, a digital controller, an SPIcompatible interface, and associated control logic.

Drive CS low to output the first bit on the SO pin. A complete serial-interface read of the cold-junction compensated thermocouple temperature requires 14 clock cycles. Thirty-two clock cycles are required to read both the thermocouple and reference junction temperatures \(Table 2 and Table 3.\) The first bit, D31, is the thermocouple temperature sign bit, and is presented to the SO pin within tDV of the falling edge of CS. Bits D\[30:18\] contain the converted temperature in the order of MSB to LSB, and are presented to the SO pin within tD0 of the falling edge of SCK. Bit D16 is normally low and goes high when the thermocouple input is open or shorted to GND or VCC. The reference junction temperature data begins with D15. CS can be taken high at any point while clocking out conversion data. If T+ and T- are unconnected, the thermocouple temperature sign bit \(D31\) is 0, and the remainder of the thermocouple temperature value \(D\[30:18\]\) is 1.![](/assets/MAX31855_SCK.png)From above graphic, it can be seen MAX31855 SPI mode 0.
