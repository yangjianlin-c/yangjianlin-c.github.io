A layer in Pro/E represents a model entities grouping (ex: features, datum planes or axes.) The layers are used to administer the entities in a model, assembly or drawing in Pro/E. Several entities can be associated to a layer, so as to manipulate them together. They can be suppressed if they are solids, and hide or be displayed in an organized fashion if they are non-solids.

The layers help to simplify a model and increase work speed.

The visibility of non-geometric entities can be controlled in a model or in assembly components with the help of layers. Also, unnecessary elements of a drawing (surfaces or datum features) can be hidden.

## What kind of items can layers manage?

Layers can manage all types of items. After they were created, several items can be associated to layers, such as: features, curves, surfaces, datum planes, text, dimensions, geometric tolerances, etc. An entity can be placed in a layer in the following ways:

*   Manually, by selecting the entities individually
*   By copying layer information
*   By creating layers and associating specific attributes automatically
