# Doherty Amplifier

invented in 1936 by W. H. Doherty.

traditional PA, class AB for example, have a low efficiency(15~25%) at backoff powers.

DPA enables high efficiency at backoff powers.

Consist of:

- two PA in parallel, Main and peak
- two 90° line at the input and output

same phase when they are ON, and same output phase 180°

- main PA is biased as class A, AB, B, F...
- peak PA is biased as class C. Which means it Vg<Vpinchoff
